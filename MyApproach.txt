Data Structures: 
Structure of MarketData is 
Unique ID is a concatenation of MarketDatatype+ "-"+ Date of fixings (in yyyymmdd) + "-" + RefCCy
MarketData Type
Date 
MarketData -Ideally this should be implemented using an interface (MarketDatAStruct) so it can be more generic

MarketData in the scenario used - FXMarketData
This consists of RefCCy (Assuming that all FX prices are basd on Eur Denomination, so not having BaseCCy)
Bid Price
Ask Price


API Methods:
GetAllITems - All marketdata items in repository 
GetItembyID  - Retrieve the fixings by the unique Id. 
CreateFXData - This is for marketdata submission. Basic Validation is done by data annotations. 
ValidationService - For the purpose of this test, doing one validation (askprice>=bid price)

For the purpose of this test , tried to use the InMemory Repository  as a database. This can be easliy switched to a database repository as it is implemented via interfaces.

ValidationService - for now using a basic validation check (askprice >= bid price)

For Unit Tests, used xUnit. Moq is to mockup the services needed.
